### WHAT IS VERDURA ENGINE
Verdura is a Basic game Engine wrote by https://github.com/hussein-mamane .
Mainly for learning purposes. 

#### Very basic
Verdura is very basic, it is for first-timers, don't take any approach 
of Verdura's code problem-solving as being a one reliable way of doing things.
Architecture choices may be unfit for other projects or maybe not respecting
all good practices.
Nonetheless, the engine can help you pass that first step in unlocking your
potential, getting the first "CLICK" of understanting how OpenGL is a 
`State Machine` a big `Context` and how you can leverage both OOP and Functional
approaches as you wish.

#### Veterans
If you a Veteran of game engines and C++,
chances are you will not learn things by looking at the verdura code,
Verdura is not being written by an industry veteran and this is why creating
github issues, to help refactor the code is welcome.

#### Dependencies
    - DearImGui (https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
    - stb_image
